# Scale

The Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Sustainability, and the Pace of Life 
in Organisms, Cities, Economies, and Companies.

## How I found the book

I was nerding out with a coworker about [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org) as it 
indirectly plays a big part in the “AI” space. Aside I am starting to see “AI” 
as the most broadly applicable but over marketed use of GPUs. Games and Crypto 
coming before it. Quoting 
[Jonathan Blow](https://youtu.be/ZSRHeXYDLko?si=k9vLo8FSUElBWOdx&t=1188) 
“Software has been free‑riding on hardware” and “Attention is all you need” 
came out in 2017.

Anyways my coworker pointed me towards Jim Keller. Never having heard of the 
guy, I was curious. I looked up the interviews he had done recently, and picked
one to listen to. I don’t recall much standing out from the interview other 
than he mentioned the book Scale and that the output of companies is roughly 
the square root of the people that work there. Finding that interesting, I 
wrote down the name of the book and, a few weeks—or maybe a month—later, I 
decided to listen to it.

## First impressions

The book is pretty dense; it goes over a huge array of topics and sources, and 
in audio form it’s just a lot to process. But it was very interesting and full 
of factoids about the world. A few highlights for me were:

- Drugs scale sublinearly with the size of the mammal (RIP 
  [Tusko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusko)).
- Temperature has an exponential effect on many things in our world beside 
  climate.
- Companies will almost always die where cities are different.

Those might not be very enticing factoids, but I think the book is worth 
starting and giving the book a try. I started to see the pattern that you find 
in a TV series where they put a different spin on the theme of the show each 
episode. In this case it was “here is this scaling factor in our world” and 
some interesting factoids in that area. The pattern was different enough each 
time that I enjoyed it. After 20 hours I was ready for something 
different—perhaps a book best absorbed in smaller doses.

To be honest some sections were somewhat depressing, but it wasn’t trying to 
market, or sell anything which I appreciate. Just a seemingly smart, 
well‑connected guy doing essentially a PHD level book report on the patterns in
our world, leaning on his physics background but attempting to dumb it down 
enough that a normal person could get something out of it.

There are rules to our world, and we have used the language of math to describe
it the best we can. He even lists the rough ratios of a lot of this data. The 
number 4 is important. Trying to absorb all of it in a single pass is a bit of 
an overload, and I mostly just listened for a long time and tried to pick up 
what I could. I wouldn’t say the book changed my life, but it did give me some 
perspective on the world. A bit depressing in sections but running from the 
problem only helps you sleep for a bit.

Wanting to give a summary or a reason why you should read or listen to the book
was what spawned this post. In hindsight of how dense it was and how little I 
am able to site from it makes me want to give it another listen and take notes 
for a better report.
